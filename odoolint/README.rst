Add runtime lint checks that don't are detected by odoo.

They are shown from logger.warning

- Demo xml_id referenced from data xml if the module is installed with `--without-demo=all`
- Unachievable xml_id if the module is installed with `-i module`
- Broken button If the module use a button action but is not defined on odoo
- Broken local path in `link` items of views, e.g. `<link /module_a/folder` and `/module_a/folder` is not exists.
- Duplicate items from selection fields e.g. `myfield = fields.Selection([('duplicated1', 'Duplicated1')])... myfield = fields.Selection(selection_add=[('duplicated1', 'Duplicated1')])`
- Superfluous dependency e.g. 
  - `sale_project: ['sale, 'project']`
  - `my_module: ['sale', 'base', 'sale_project', 'project']`
  `sale`, `project` and `base` are superfluous in `my_module` because `sale_project` contains them.
- Add check to validate non boolean values in boolean fields e.g.
  - `<field name="active">False</field>` It's processed like as a True and you should fix it with `<field name="customer" eval="False"/>`
  - For your information a Pull Request to change this behaviour: https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/13152
- Add a log error if there is a 404 code in the message of werkzeug logger
